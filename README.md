# PONG

This is my take on the classic game Pong. Built as an introduction into simple web games with graphics.

## Future improvements

1. Add bounce mechanic for ball when hitting top or bottom of padels (currently only supports bouncing off the inner facing side)
2. Display the score
3. Automatically reset game and update score when ball goes out of bounds
4. Add a start button
